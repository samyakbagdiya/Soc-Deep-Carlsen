Week 1: I focused on learning the basics of Python through Mosh's tutorial, which provided a strong foundation for my coding skills. I also explored Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, which helped me understand code organization and reusability.

Week 2: I delved into deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch. After evaluating both options, I decided to concentrate on Tensorflow. I followed a Tensorflow tutorial to learn how to build neural networks and handle data. I also curated a list of additional reading materials to expand my knowledge.

Week 3: I dedicated this week to thoroughly reading the research paper that forms the basis of my project. By understanding the proposed ideas, algorithms, and methodologies, I developed a rough implementation plan. This plan outlines the key steps and components needed to bring the research paper's concepts to life.

In summary, I have gained proficiency in Python, explored OOP principles, learned the fundamentals of Tensorflow, and thoroughly studied the research paper. These  set the stage for the next phase of the project, where I will begin implementing the concepts outlined in the paper.
